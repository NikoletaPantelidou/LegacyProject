# What is this project about?
The idea of this project is to clone a project from a different group and make improvements in terms of functionality and the user experience. 

# What project did we choose and what did we fix?
With my pair, we decided to clone a project, called Book-App that it is an e-shop for books. Specifically, the admin can add, delete or update a book and its information. We fixed problems in terms of functionality such as 
the delete button and we did improvements on the design of the page like the separation of the log-in and register page, the enhancement of the nav bar and we took care of the general user experience.

# What are the main technologies?
It is a project based on CRUD operations. Also, the main technologies and programming languages are Javascript, React and MongoDB for the database.
